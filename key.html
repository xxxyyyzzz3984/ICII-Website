<b>Keynote speaker:</b> Dr. Vinton G. Cerf &emsp; (Vice President and Chief Internet Evangelist, Google)<br>
<b>Title:</b> Musings on the Industrial Internet<br>
<b>Abstract:</b> The Industrial Internet is a concept that I think could be represented by a major manufacturing plant filled with Internet of Things (IoT) devices, robots, and other programmable systems all communicating over the Internet or an internet. One could add to that picture, a global supply chain system that uses the Internet to order, track, pay for and possibly manage or control devices used in Industrial settings. The magnitude of the access control and end-to-end authentication process should not be underestimated. Nor should the role of  standards in achieving interoperability among the devices and systems of the Industrial Internet ecosystem. The challenges found in the residential IoT are simply magnified in an industrial setting especially with a wide-ranging mixture of devices made by different manufacturers. These are stakeholders in the multi-national, multi-vendor system that needs global interoperabililty.<br>
<b>Bio:</b> Vinton G. Cerf has served as vice president and chief Internet evangelist for Google since October 2005. In this role, he contributes to global policy development, standardization and continued spread of the Internet. Cerf is the former senior vice president of Technology Strategy for MCI. In this role, Cerf was responsible for helping to guide corporate strategy development from the technical perspective. Previously, Cerf served as MCI’s senior vice president of Architecture and Technology, leading a team of architects and engineers to design advanced networking frameworks including Internet­based solutions for delivering a combination of data, information, voice and video services for business and consumer use. Widely known as one of the “Fathers of the Internet,” Cerf is the co­designer of the TCP/IP protocols and the architecture of the Internet.  He is a recipient of numerous awards and commendations in connection with his work on the Internet. <br>

<b>Keynote speaker:</b> Dr. Renwei Li &emsp; (Chief Scientist and Vice President of the Future Networks, Huawei)<br>
<b>Title:</b> What if We Reimagine a New Internet?<br>
<b>Abstract:</b> The Internet is one of the most successful technical achievements of our time. However, it is reaching the limits of what it can support in the face of emerging applications and services such as massive machine type communications (mMTC), ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC), and tactile internet, which often require, for example, precisely guaranteed low latency and high throughput instead of best-effort routing and forwarding. Now it becomes imminent to reimagine and redesign the next-generation internet. This talk analyzes the current Internet's constraints, identifies new underlying design principles, and outlines a new framework and a new protocol, called New IP. New IP extends IP in order to evolve an essentially best-effort Internet to a best-guarantee Internet that will power the next wave of future networking applications including Industrial Internet.<br>
<b>Bio:</b> Dr. Renwei Li (Richard) is Chief Scientist and Vice-President of the Future Networks at Huawei USA, where he leads a group of senior research scientists, architects and engineers to design and develop next-generation network architectures, technologies, protocols, solutions, and software.  An area of his particular focus is on Industrial Internet. In his career with Huawei, Richard has worked as Vice-President and Head of the Internet Technology Lab of Huawei USA, and spearheaded the technology innovation and software development in the area of Routing and MPLS, Cloud and Virtualization, SDN, and Orchestration. Prior to joining Huawei, he worked with Cisco and Ericsson in his various capacities, being a major contributor to their networking technologies, standards, solutions and operating systems. Richard also serves as Vice Chair of ETSI ISG NGP, an industrial specification group on next-generation protocols within European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI). He also works to bridge between scientific, academic and industrial research and cultures. <br>
